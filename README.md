# top-etch-a-sketch
My etch-a-sketch build, part of The Odin Project.
This is my 2nd project from TOP in which I'll be using Javascript!:)

The user will have the possibility to select a number of squares/side and then they will be generated through JS. I will also want to give the user the ability to change the color or just have the colors randomly change from square to square.
